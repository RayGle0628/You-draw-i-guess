# You-draw-i-

Product introduction:

After a number theory discussion, our group always felt that it was a small game of "You Draw Me Guess". In fact, the game has not yet determined the specific name, but it should have multiple clients, a server, and then carry out multi-threaded concurrent communication. Allow different members to join a game room and play "you draw me guess" games in that room. By connecting to the database, the user can create an account and log in. When the account is successfully verified, the user can freely enter the main page and start the game.
The game also saves, updates, and resets the game's data through the database. And you can view the scores the user has obtained and the score ranking. You can also change passwords, reset passwords, etc. through the database background.
